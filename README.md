# MermyLinux (import logotype here instead later)

**Mermy Linux** is (or will be) an Arch-based Linux distribution with no focus or point whatsoever.

### The main features of Mermy Linux _should_ (if I make the ISOs right) include:
- KDE Plasma with actually good keyboard shortcuts out of the box
- Fish shell with TIDE for users
- Uhh... we'll find out more one day

I advise you to literally never install this distribution on bare metal with the expectation that it will work, let alone be able to daily drive it.
Purely made for fun and testing purposes. Expect very minimal maintenance, as this is work-in-progress, I don't know what the hell I'm doing, and I am usually lazy.
